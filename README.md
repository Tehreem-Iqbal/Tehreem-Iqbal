### Hi there 👋

I'm a Malware Researcher at Ebryx. 

### What I do

 🐲 Dig into malware to understand how they work
 
 🪱 Develop new malware
 
 🥷 I also help test our defenses by pretending to be a hacker, a bit like playing spy games (Red Teamer).
 
When I'm not fighting cyber baddies, I'm busy checking for weak spots in our systems to keep everything safe and sound. I love learning about new tricks and tools in cybersecurity to stay ahead of the game.
